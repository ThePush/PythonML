    Add polynomial features to vector x by raising its values up to the power given in argument.

    Args:
    x: has to be an numpy.array, a vector of dimension m * 1.
    power: has to be an int, the power up to which the components of vector x are going to be raised.

    Return:
    The matrix of polynomial features as a numpy.array, of dimension m * n,
    containing the polynomial feature values for all training examples.
    None if x is an empty numpy.array.
    None if x or power is not of expected type.

    This function should not raise any Exception.
